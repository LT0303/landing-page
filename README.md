# landing-page

This is a landing page site I made for The Odin Project's landing page project. Over the course of completing this project,
I practiced using various flexbox controls, using margins alongside flexbox, editing border radii, implementing padding to
align elements, using classes and different kinds of combinators, implementing different font families, using div/flex containers
to group different flex items together, using different height and width values to size items and the page itself, using 
hex colors for text and background, and using using different font styles and weights.

I also learned the importance of completing the html boilerplate and page structure before moving on to CSS, the flexbox
attributes. This makes completing the stylesheet much easier even accounting for needing to revise the HTML.
